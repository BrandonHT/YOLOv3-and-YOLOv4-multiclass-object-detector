# YOLOv3-and-YOLOv4-multiclass
Repository with python notebooks for training and testing YOLOV3 and YOLOV4 models for multiclass object detection using the **Darknet** framework.
The notebooks were developed in the **Google Colab** environment to use the free GPU provided by Google. 

For further documentation about Darknet framework please review the [AlexeyAB Darknet repository](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet).

**Note:** If you want to use the resources of this repo in your thesis project of investigation, the only thing that I ask to you is please cite it or include the link to reach more people.
